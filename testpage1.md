'''Python''' is a programming language with widespread use inside and outside Equinor. It is very popular in many scientific fields, and in [[data science]]. Python has the following features: # Open source, cross-platform, widely used. # Relatively high-level, readable, and easy to learn. # Interpreted: Python is compiled internally, not by the programmer. # Dynamically typed, so you don't need to declare the type of a variable. # Versatile with respect to paradigms, supporting procedural, object-oriented and functional patterns. # Lots of built-in capabilities, plus a large ecosystem of third-party packages. ==Python on Windows== It is recommended to install Python through '''AccessIT''' and '''Equinor Applications'''. Alernatively, you can install Python using the <code>uv</code> package and environment manager. See [[Installing Python on Windows with uv]]. ===''Without'' a developer profile=== See [[Installing Python on Windows]]. ===''With'' a developer profile=== If you have a developer profile, you may have more options in addition to the method described in [[Installing Python on Windows]]. It is possible to download an [https://www.python.org/downloads/ installer] for Python from the Python Software Foundation and run this under <code>C:\Appl</code>, for instance. ==Using Python on Linux machines== Python is available on all Linux distros. On an Equinor machine running RedHat, you probably want to use a [[Komodo]] environment, eg using <code>komodoenv</code>. ==Using Jupyter Notebooks== {{Main|Jupyter Notebook}} Notebooks are popular with students, scientists, and data scientists. They are also commonly used for teaching Python. You can use notebooks by installing Jupyter in your environment, then starting a notebook server with '''jupyter notebook''' or '''jupyter lab''' on the command line. You can also open notebook files ('''.ipynb''') with some editors, eg [[Microsoft VS Code]] and [[PyCharm]]. Notebook files are also rendered automatically by [[GitHub]] and [[GitLab]]. You should note that there are limitations for using notebooks for software development. Check the entry for "Jupyter notebooks" in the [https://techradar.equinor.com/ tech radar] for advice about recommended uses / limits of Jupyter notebooks. ==To upgrade pip== When using pip to install packages, you should use a dedicated [[Virtual environments|virtual environment]] for each project you are working on. If you try to upgrade pip (and you should) by the regular <code>pip install --upgrade pip</code> you will get this error: (my_env) C:\Appl>pip install --upgrade pip ERROR: To modify pip, please run the following command: c:\Appl\env\scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip You are using pip version 10.0.1, however version 19.1 is available. You should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command. Follow the directions, that is, use (my_env) C:\Appl>c:\appl\Python36\my_env\scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip == FAQ == ; I get an error <code>Error: [WinError 1260] This program is blocked by group policy</code> : You need to do everything in <code>C:\Appl</code> ; How do I install XYZ : 1. Do due diligence on the package XYZ. 2. Activate your virtualenv. 3. type <code>pip install XYZ</code>. ; I get an error containing <code><class 'requests.exceptions.SSLError'></code> : Go to [https://equinor.slack.com/messages/C68CNC0M7 #python] and ask, we currently don't know how Windows behaves ; I try to start Jupyter notebook, I get this error: 'jupyter is not recognize as an internal command, operable program or batch file' : In the cmd, navigate to the folder where you want to save your Jupyter notebooks (for expl C:\Users\xxxx\Documents) and write C:\Appl\python_start\Scripts\jupyter-notebook.exe ; I don't really know what to do next : Take a Python course in Equinor, or ask for help on the [https://equinor.slack.com/messages/C68CNC0M7 Python channel on Slack] ; Why does Python open Microsoft Store? : The folder WindowsApps within AppData has a bunch of executables that launch the Microsoft Store application allowing the user to download python. Use the Windows search bar to find "Manage app execution aliases". There should be two aliases for python (App Installer), unselect them, this will allow the usual python aliases "python" and "python3". ; I have installed Python version X from the Microsoft Store but I have also an earlier python installation. I am not an administrator of my PC and can not uninstall the old Python installation. How can I force my PC to not use this old python installation? : Rename the Python folder from e.g. C:\Appl\Python36 to C:\Appl\Python36_do not use. The PC will now not be able to find and use the Python 3.6 installation. ; I have installed Python 3.9 from the Microsoft Store but have also an earlier python installation. Where is everything installed and how do I access the correct python version? : In '''CMD''' type <code>where python</code>: F:\>where python C:\Appl\Python36\python.exe C:\Users\Shortname\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python.exe : Microsoft Store installs Python 3.9 in '''C:\Users\Shortname\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\'''. In this example, an earlier installation of Python 3.6 (installed from Equinor Applications) is listed first and has higher priority. It will start instead if you type <code>python</code> or <code>pip</code>. In order to access the new installation, in '''CMD''' type <code>python3.9</code> and <code>pip3.9</code>. (Should <code>python3.9</code> not work, use the Windows search bar to find "Manage app execution aliases" and make sure that the python3.9.exe alias is turned on). Next, you can create a virtual environment for Python 3.9 and activate it: F:\>C: C:\>cd Appl\ C:\Appl>python3.9 -m venv my_venv_39 C:\Appl>my_venv_39\Scripts\activate (my_venv_39) C:\Appl> (my_venv_39) C:\Appl>pip --version pip 21.1.3 from c:\appl\my_venv_39\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.9) : Inside your virtual environment, the <code>python</code> and <code>pip</code> commands work on the 3.9 version and you can install your packages the normal way. == Other resources == * [https://engage.cloud.microsoft/main/org/statoil.com/groups/eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiIxMDE0NDE4MiJ9 Python community on Viva Engage] * [https://app.slack.com/client/T02JL00JU/C68CNC0M7 Python channel on Slack] == External links == * [http://www.codecademy.com Online Python course] * [https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html 10 Minutes to pandas] * [http://kanoki.org/2017/07/16/pandas-in-a-nutshell/ Pandas in a nutshell] == See also == * [[Installing Python on Windows]] * [[Accessing Equinor data with Python]] * [[Scientific Python]] * [[Useful Python packages]] * [[Functional programming in Python]] * [[GPU programming with Python]] * [[Python coding standard]] [[Category:Python]] [[Category:Programming languages]] [[Category:Linux]]
